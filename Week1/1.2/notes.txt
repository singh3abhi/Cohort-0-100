1)Why Languages ?
Languages are basically used to write the high level code by humans which are compiled by the compilers to create program with 0's & 1's for the RAM/CPU to run

2)Compiled vs Interpreted Languages
Some languages are first compiled and then executed like c, c++ etc. Those languages are called compiled languages
where as there are some languages like js, etc which compile and execute line by line these languages are called Scripting/Interpreted Languages

3)Strict vs Dynamic Languages
a)Strict languages are those languages which restricts variables to have fix type for ex c, c++ etc
b)Dynamic languages are those languages which does let you changes the type of variables for ex js

4)Single threaded vs MultiThreaded Languages
a)Languages which can work only on one core/thread are Single threaded languages like js but there are some ways to use multi threaded usecase with js ( Will learn later on )
b)Languages which can divide their work into multiple threads/cores are MultiThreaded Languages like java, goLang etc
